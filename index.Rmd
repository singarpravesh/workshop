## Welcome!

---

In this introductory course we shall learn about setting up [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.org/) locally. We shall then learn some basic and fundamental principles of R before moving into the `tidyverse`. In the `tidyverse` we shall explore data visualisation, data transformation, EDA, tidying data, reading and writing data, and some basic model building. We shall also work with NNSO data with the tools we learn.
